<div class="author"><a id='magicparlabel-1414' />Eden Segal - The 8th mage</div>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1410' />So I decided to make a Dwarf fortress clone, And by that I of course mean nothing, because Dwarf fortress is too big to make, let alone to recreate. The thing I basically decided to care about is handling a &ldquo;job system&rdquo; in which several dwarfs at the same time work in unison to build something, which may have nothing to do with DF specifically. I decided about that because of day 7 of Advent of Code 2018, which made me think about those systems. I liked that because of the parallel nature of the jobs, which can bring some performance using several workers. Also I want some more programming experience in places I won't touch in work. </div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1406' />I also decided to do the project with a blog beside it, because I want the publicity, and I also want the motivation to write. My thinking is that I may abandon this project at any time so I should make the best of it while it lasts. My goal is to program on the weekends and write the blog on weekdays, maybe uploading it by Monday or Tuesday. </div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1404' />What i have at the moment: <a href="Dwarf Like Fortress 11_03_19.mp4">Dwarfs running around</a>. You can see the wonderous dwarfs in gray running around to catch rocks in red, and delivering it to their final destination in gray. Now that we have that, what more can you need? Why would you even need a job system to replace those workers? </div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1402' />So here is what my thinking about what the job system will be, and of course, when I'll know better i will write again:</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1400' />1. The job system should be able to have a graph that defines the job. say, a chair can be made out of a rock in a factory, or sandstone can be turned into silicon that with metal can be made to be a cpu. I wrote these 2 examples in the text editor :</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1398' /><img style='width:20%;' src='capture.png' alt='image: 2D__projects_Dwarf_like_Fortress_blog_capture.png' />
</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1396' />2. dwarfs can pick up jobs in any order as long as the requirements are fulfilled. </div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1473' />So with that in mind, I think I will try to make that happen, and see where I end up.</div>
