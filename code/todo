1. you now have dwarfs great. 
	they can move around in a rudimentory fashion. they have no lookup functions:(
2. But you want a job system. what does it mean?
2.1 Chairs, you want dwarfs to make chairs. This means:
* need to bring rocks into factory.
* need to have a dwarf make chairs out of rock.
2.2 so factories need to know what they need, and then have a dwarf
	bring it. 
2.3 maybe factories put job into job queue?
2.4 maybe dig_rock should have a dst? then each work will have pos and dst.
2.5 first bring rock into target-> then bring rock from target to factory.
2.6 but why does it need to know the src? can't it just look for it?
3.  if each job has a dst why not more? 
3.1 why can't the phases be Jobs.
4. i want a fucking graph of jobs!
4.1 How do i get a "fucking graph of jobs" that's the problem.
4.2 Let's think about a graph

	  -chair*4
	 /		  \
rock- 		  -- garden furniture.
	 \		 /
	  -table/

4.3 Let's think of a better graph

	  sandstone-silicon
	 /				   \
rock-					cpu\
	 \		  			/	\
		metal ore-metal/	 computer.
							 /
oil----plastic-computer case/

Yes you can turn rock into sandstone. 

so real Todo:
1. Job system should be a graph based system where the "user"
   declares the end goal. 
   But the workers can take work at any time. if they have the requirements.
2. first make a chair rock->chair.
3. 4*chairs+table->garden furniture.
4. something like the graph above.
